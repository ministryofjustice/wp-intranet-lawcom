Many of our stakeholders responded and were highly supportive of our law reform work. MoJ\u0092s conclusion to Stage One was that there is a continuing need for the Commission\u0092s functions and the arm\u0092s-length model is the most appropriate for us to maintain our technical expertise and independence from Government.<br><br>Stage Two of the review examined our control and governance arrangements. The report identifies a number of areas of particularly good practice. It refers to our open and transparent approach to law reform and policy making as \u0093an exemplar of the kind of open policy making championed in the Civil Service Reform Plan\u0094.<br><br>The report also contains several recommendations for where we can improve our corporate governance, including clarifying some roles and responsibilities within the Commission and formalising our relationship with the MoJ sponsorship team. I shall report back to you as we make progress in both these areas.<br><br>I encourage you to read the reports from both <a href=\"http:\/\/lawcommission.justice.gov.uk\/publications\/triennial-reviews.htm\" target=\"_new\">Stages One and Two<\/a>.

at the Law Commission to complete the survey.\u00a0 This is a real opportunity for you to have your say in the way our organisation is run and we do take action as a result.<br><br>After the last survey we ran discussions within teams about the results and I also ran a workshop for everyone.\u00a0 As a result of these we introduced a suggestions box, arranged management training for our line managers, held our away \u00bd day in the summer and ran a number of workshops to seek your views and feedback on our business plan and the office move.\u00a0 We\u0092ve also increased our lunchtime seminars and I have held an update session on roughly a quarterly basis to share news about developments affecting our organisation.<br><br>So your views do count.\u00a0 Please therefore take time to complete the survey.\u00a0 And remember that the majority of the questions are seeking your views on the Law Commission, not the MoJ or wider civil service.<br><br>I look forward to seeing the results

password is unique and generated at the start.\u00a0 It cannot be recovered or traced if you do not make a note of it.<br><br>\n<\/li>\n<li>When you are completing the survey, please note the

for the upgrade are to improve\u00a0the reliability of the database\u00a0(by moving it to a new SQL server more compatible with an Access database)\u00a0<strong>and<\/strong> to\u00a0introduce a new email facility (see more below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The new email facility is an additional mailshot option.\u00a0 In future, in addition to using the database to create alphabetically sorted lists,

following update from the DIR team.<br><br>Some of you have now been waiting over three weeks to have your archive content moved.\u00a0 We\u0092re sorry that this has taken longer than expected; there is a large amount of archive data on the servers and it is taking a long time to process.\u00a0 Please be reassured that the move will be completed soon.\n<p>We know that some of you use your archive files as part of your mailbox filing system and the freeze period has been especially inconvenient for you.\u00a0 However, there are a few simple actions you can take during these transitional few weeks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember that EV is now monitoring your mailbox size and archiving for you.\u00a0 Your mailbox is not getting full and you will not be prevented from sending or receiving mail. <\/li>\n<li>Now that your mailbox has become larger, you can file your mail into sub-folders underneath your Inbox (these are not frozen).\u00a0 You can create new sub-folders instantly by right-clicking on your Inbox and selecting \u0091New folder\u0092. <\/li>\n<li>If you\u0092re still not sure what should be happening, we highly recommend looking at the video \u0091Managing your mailbox from freeze to finish\u0092 on the EV intranet site.\u00a0 The video takes just over a minute and shows you clearly what happens next.\u00a0 It also gives you guidance about coping during the freeze.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you still have questions after watching the video, please contact <a href=\"mailto:Enterprise.Vault@justice.gsi.gov.uk\">Enterprise Vault<\/a>.<br><br><strong>On behalf of
